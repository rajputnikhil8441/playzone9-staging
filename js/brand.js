/* ============================================================
   THE PLAYZONE9 BRAND
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Load order on every page:
       js/cms-config.js  ->  js/brand.js  ->  js/cms.js
   Priority, lowest first:
       cms.js DEFAULTS  <  THIS FILE  <  Supabase row  <  local edits

   WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR

   js/cms.js ships the SHAPE of a brand -- every key the CMS
   expects to exist -- with no brand in it. Not one Playzone9 string,
   domain or page title. That is deliberate: DEFAULTS is shared
   by every brand, so anything left in it is inherited by every
   brand, and a second site would quietly render Playzone9's copy
   wherever its own record happened to be missing a key.

   So the brand lives here. This file is Playzone9 and nothing else.
   A second brand ships its own copy of this file with its own
   values and inherits none of the below.

   WHEN IT IS READ

   It is the fallback a visitor sees when Supabase cannot be
   reached, while the request is still in flight, or when their
   browser has nothing cached. Published content in the Supabase
   row overrides all of it, so on a healthy live site these
   values are rarely what renders -- which is exactly why they
   have to be right: they are what shows when things are not
   healthy.

   Note what is NOT here. Each page's static .html file already
   carries its own title, description and copy baked in, and
   cms.js never overwrites a static tag with an empty value. So a
   brand that omitted a key here would still render its own
   static text rather than another brand's.

   To refresh it: /admin > Export / Import > Download brand.js,
   then replace this file and redeploy. Editing it by hand is
   fine too -- it is plain JSON.
